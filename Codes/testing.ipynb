The giving or receipt of gifts is not prohibited, i f the following requirements are met:  ¬ As long as the gift is worth not more than USD 30/ -.  ¬ It is not made with the intention of influencing a  third party to obtain or retain  business or a business   __ advantage, or to reward the provision or retenti on of business or a business  advantage, or in explicit or         implicit excha nge for favours or benefits;  ¬ It complies with local law;  ¬ It is given in our name, not in your name;  ¬ It does not include cash or a cash equivalent (suc h as gift certificates or vouchers);  ¬ It is appropriate in the circumstances;  ¬ Taking into account the reason for the gift, it is  of an appropriate type and value and  given at an appropriate          time;  ¬ It is given openly, not secretly; and  ¬ Gifts should not be offered to, or accepted from, government officials or  representatives, or politicians or          political parties.     We appreciate that the practice of giving business gifts varies between countries and  regions and what may be normal and acceptable in on e region may not be in another.  The test to be applied is whether in all the circum stances the gift or hospitality is  reasonable and justifiable. The intention behind th e gift should always be considered.
